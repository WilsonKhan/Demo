/*
 *  camera_display.sv -- show the frame buffer on the monitor: an Avalon-ST video source.
 *
 *  Exactly the source you wrote for Lesson 3 Task 3.2 (vga_face) and used in the Assignment 2
 *  display: a raster position that advances on every valid & ready handshake, startofpacket on
 *  pixel (0,0), endofpacket on the last, 30-bit RGB out. The VGA Controller (vga_sink.qsys, the
 *  University Program core) does the sync signals and the DAC.
 *
 *  The stored picture is 320x240 and the screen is 640x480, so each stored pixel is shown as a
 *  2x2 block: the read address is (x/2, y/2). The frame buffer's read port is registered (one clock
 *  of latency), so the address is formed from the NEXT position and presented one handshake ahead:
 *  by the time the raster reaches a pixel, its data is already on rd_pixel. While the controller is
 *  not ready (its blanking: 160 clocks a line, 45 lines a frame, and any other stall) the address
 *  must point at the CURRENT position, or the port fetches the pixel after the one on offer and the
 *  controller accepts the wrong one when it resumes.
 *
 *  And one more rule for a single frame buffer: the camera keeps writing while the display is
 *  stalled, and it can overwrite the very word on offer. The read port is live, so the offer would
 *  change under the controller. So the first stalled cycle copies the offer into a register, and
 *  the source offers that copy until the handshake (Avalon-ST: data holds until it is taken).
