/*
 *  clock_divider.sv -- divide a clock by an even integer with a counter.
 *
 *  clk_out toggles every DIVISOR/2 cycles of clk_in, so f_out = f_in / DIVISOR
 *  with a 50% duty cycle. Used here for the SCCB bit clock (100 kHz from the 25 MHz pixel clock, DIVISOR = 250),
 *  which is far too slow for the PLL. A divided clock like this is fine for a
 *  slow serial interface; for anything fast use a PLL or a clock enable instead.
