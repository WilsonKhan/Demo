/*
 *  frame_buffer.sv -- one, two or three pictures in on-chip memory, written by the camera, read by the display.
 *
 *  Two clocks meet here and nowhere else. The camera writes at its own PCLK (20 MHz, one pixel
 *  every two clocks, 25 frames a second; 40 MHz and 50 at CAMERA_FPS = 50); the display reads at the VGA pixel clock (25 MHz, 60 frames
 *  a second, and never in step with the camera). A Cyclone V M10K block has two ports with independent
 *  clocks, so the memory itself is the clock-domain crossing for the pixels: each side uses its own port.
 *  (With two or three banks, only the bank numbers cross through synchronisers: see below.)
 *
 *  The camera's 640x480 does not fit: 307,200 x 16 bits = 4.9 Mbit, and the chip has 4.45 Mbit
 *  in total. So the writer keeps one pixel in DECIMATE (2) along each row and one row in DECIMATE:
 *  320x240 x 16 bits = 1.23 Mbit. That is decimation without a filter, and
 *  it is also exactly the size the Assignment 2 pipeline works on. Quartus infers the RAM from
 *  the two always blocks below (simple dual-port, dual clock); no wizard file is needed.
 *
 *  How much memory a picture takes is not the bit count: an M10K block is 256 x 40, 512 x 20,
 *  1024 x 10 ..., so a 16-bit word sits in a 20-bit slot and a 320x240 picture is 150 of the
 *  DE1-SoC's 397 blocks. With PACKED = 1 the pixels are stored as RGB444 (the top four bits of
 *  each channel) and THREE of them fill a 40-bit word: about 100 blocks
 *  per picture (107 words a row, so 101 by the arithmetic). The interface stays RGB565 in and out; the low bits are the only thing lost.
 *
 *  BUFFERS = 1  one picture (the top level's choice). A displayed frame can be half old and half new
 *               (tearing) when the reader overtakes the writer mid-frame: a moving hand shows a seam.
 *               150 blocks, or about 100 packed.
 *  BUFFERS = 3  no tearing, every camera frame shown: one bank is being written, one is being
 *               read, one holds the last complete frame. The display is faster than the camera, so
 *               it shows some frames twice and is never waiting. 450 blocks at 16 bits, which the
 *               chip does not have. Packed, the whole design takes 342 of the 397 in our tests, which fits.
 *  BUFFERS = 2  no tearing, but only every OTHER camera frame is stored: while the display is still
 *               on the frame before last, the only bank free is the one it is about to switch to,
 *               so the writer sits that frame out. (Two banks would be enough if the two sides ran
 *               in step; they do not.) 300 blocks, or about 200 packed by the arithmetic.
 *
 *  How the banks are handed over: at `wr_frame_start` (the camera's VSYNC falling edge, from
 *  ov7670_capture: the previous frame is complete by then, and the next one's pixels are 17 lines
 *  away) the writer marks the bank it has just filled as `done`. The reader moves to `done` only at
 *  the top of its own frame, so what it shows is one complete camera frame, top line included. The
 *  top of its frame is the first (0,0) it presents after it has been on the last row. (camera_display
 *  shows each stored row on two lines, so it presents (0,0) twice a frame: at the end of the previous
 *  frame, and again at the end of its first line. Only the first is a frame top.)
 *  At the same `wr_frame_start` the writer picks its next bank, one the reader is not on and cannot
 *  move to. The reader only ever moves to `done` as it knows it, and it hears of a new `done` a few
 *  clocks late, so just after the frame start it may still move to the previous one. Its bank, as
 *  the writer knows it, is a few clocks old too. So the writer picks a bank that is none of these
 *  three: the one it has just filled, the previous `done`, and the reader's as last reported. (After
 *  a skipped frame the first two are the same bank.) If there is none, it skips the frame. With
 *  three banks and a display faster than the camera, the reader is on the previous `done` by the
 *  next frame start, so there is always one.
 *  The two bank numbers cross clock domains as a stable value plus a toggle bit, each toggle through
 *  two flip-flops (Lesson 4 1.3: the value is written a clock before the toggle flips, and read only
 *  after the toggle has been seen to change).
