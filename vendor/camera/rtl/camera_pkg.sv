/*
 *  camera_pkg.sv -- the pixel formats the camera code passes around.
 *
 *  The OV7670 is configured for RGB565 (COM7 = 0x04 and COM15 = 0xD0 in ov7670_config.sv, after its
 *  software reset): two bytes per pixel, first byte {R[7:3], G[7:5]}, second byte {G[4:2], B[7:3]}
 *  (datasheet Figure 11). ov7670_capture.sv joins the two bytes into one 16-bit word,
 *  {first, second} = {R5, G6, B5}. Everything downstream (frame buffer, display, your Assignment 2
 *  pipeline) wants either 8-bit RGB or 8-bit grey: these two functions are that conversion, and
 *  nothing else in the design knows about 565.
