/*
 *  ov7670_config.sv -- put the camera into a known state over the SCCB, then get out of the way.
 *
 *  The OV7670's control bus, SCCB, is I2C with a different name: START, the ID byte 0x42 (7-bit
 *  address 0x21 + write), one register address byte, one data byte, a ninth clock after each byte,
 *  STOP. That is exactly the transaction i2c_master.sv (Lesson 3, Task 2.1) sends to the WM8731,
 *  so the same master is used here unchanged; only the address and the list of writes differ.
 *  SCCB calls the ninth bit "don't care" rather than ACK, but the OV7670 pulls it low, so the master
 *  sees an ACK and `error` stays 0.
 *
 *  Sequence, and why (datasheet Table 4, p.6):
 *    1. hold RESET# low for T_RESET, release it, and wait T_SETTLE: the chip needs up to 1 ms
 *       after any reset before it answers (tS:RESET). Writes sent earlier are lost, and the camera
 *       ends up half configured (a green picture until you press reset);
 *    2. write COM7 = 0x80, the software reset, and wait T_SETTLE again (counted from the start of
 *       that write, so about 1.7 ms after its STOP);
 *    3. write the rest of the ROM, one register per transaction, sending a write that got no
 *       acknowledge again before the next one (a wire off, or XCLK not running: the chip needs its
 *       clock to answer);
 *    4. `done` goes high once the last write has been acknowledged, and stays high. The video port
 *       has been streaming since step 1; it just streams the *configured* format from here on.
 *
 *  Changing the registers. Nothing you write is permanent. The registers go back to their defaults
 *  at power-up and whenever RESET# is pulsed. This module pulses RESET# at start-up and at every
 *  press of KEY0 (top_level.sv), and then sends the whole list again. The datasheet warns of damage
 *  only beyond its absolute maximum ratings (Table 2), which are voltages and temperatures, not
 *  register values. Some values do stop the picture until you take them out and reset the camera:
 *    - COM2 bit 4, soft sleep;
 *    - a test pattern instead of the picture (COM7 bit 1, COM17 bit 3, or bit 7 of SCALING_XSC or
 *      SCALING_YSC);
 *    - a format, size or sync polarity that ov7670_capture.sv does not expect (COM7, COM15, COM10,
 *      COM14, and the scaling and window registers);
 *    - a PCLK faster than the 40 MHz the design is constrained for (CLKRC, DBLV and COM14's divider
 *      set it).
 *  Try a change in simulation first. In the configuration bench (tb/ov7670_config_tb.sv) the camera
 *  model reports every write in words, in its [OV7670 ...] lines, and the bench FAILs on purpose, and
 *  says why, when the format, size, sync polarity or PCLK is not the course's, or when a test pattern
 *  is on.
 *
 *  The frame rate, FPS: 50 frames a second (the default), or 25 for a dim room. FPS = 25 halves the
 *  camera's clock with its prescaler (CLKRC = 0x81), so each frame lasts 40 ms instead of 20 and the
 *  camera can expose it for up to twice as long: in a dim room the picture is clearer, with less gain,
 *  less noise and darker blacks (measured on a board). Only three entries of the list change (CLKRC
 *  and the banding filter's two values, below), and nothing else in the design: ov7670_capture.sv
 *  follows VSYNC and HREF, whatever the rate. top_level.sv sets it (CAMERA_FPS).
 *
 *  Clocked by the SCCB bit clock (100 kHz from clock_divider.sv), like set_audio_encoder.sv, so
 *  the millisecond waits are counts of a few hundred.
