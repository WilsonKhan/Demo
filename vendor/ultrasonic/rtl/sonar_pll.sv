/*
 *  sonar_pll.sv -- 50 MHz in, 43.904 MHz out, using the PLL Intel FPGA IP.
 *
 *  Why 43.904 MHz? sonar_range.sv counts clock cycles while ECHO is high and
 *  reports distance = count >> 8. Sound covers 1 mm there-and-back in
 *  2 mm / 343 m/s = 5.831 us, and 5.831 us x 43.904 MHz = 256.0 cycles: so
 *  256 cycles per millimetre, and dividing by 256 is a shift.
 *
 *  Written out by hand, like Lesson 3's adc_pll.sv and video_pll.sv (the
 *  altera_pll you set up in Lesson 3's Task 1.2), so the project has no wizard
 *  files. The PLL cannot make every frequency exactly: Quartus
 *  picks the nearest ratio its counters allow and reports the actual output
 *  frequency in the fitter report (Fitter > PLL Usage Summary). A few ppm of
 *  error is a fraction of a millimetre; the sensor itself is worse than that.
 *
 *  Simulators cannot run the PLL primitive without Intel's libraries, so in
 *  simulation (Verilator, or ModelSim via its MODEL_TECH define) the module
 *  becomes a behavioural stand-in: a clock generator at the same frequency.
